## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

I'm in the middle of switching role from e-commerce specialist into data analyst. Right now I'm focusing on Python, R and SQL to grow and achive fluency in those languages. I also enjoy using Tableau for visializations.  

Here I gather my analysis, projects and all resources that help me to develop in data-related field.
